INTRODUCTION:

Data analytics converts raw data into actionable insights. It includes a range of tools,

technologies, and processes used to find trends and solve problems by using data. Data

analytics can shape business processes, improve decision-making, a this type of analysis helps

describe or summaries quantitative data by presenting statistics.

For example, descriptive statistical analysis could show sales distribution across a group of 

employees and the average sales figure per employee. Descriptive analysis answers the question, 

“What happened and foster business growth. 

MEANING:

Data Analysis is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to

describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data.

NEED OF DATA ANALYTICS:

The use of data analytics in product development is a reliable understanding of future

requirements.

The company will understand the current market situation of the product.

They can use the techniques to develop new products as per market requirements.

The ability to make data-driven decisions can give organizations a competitive edge in

their markets. Data analysts are essential for leveraging the power of data.

They use data and turn it into meaningful insights that can drive better decision-making.

Data analytics is important because it helps businesses optimize their performances.

Implementing it into the business model means companies can help reduce costs by

identifying more efficient ways of doing business and by storing large amounts of data.

 Improved Decision-Making – If we will have supporting data in favor of a decision 

that then we will be able to implement them with even more success probability. For 

example, if a certain decision or plan has to lead to better outcomes then there will be 

no doubt in implementing them again.

 Better Customer Service – Churn modeling is the best example of this in which we try 

to predict or identify what leads to customer churn and change those things accordingly 

so, that the attrition of the customers is as low as possible which is a most important 

factor in any organization.

 Efficient Operations – Data Analytics can help us understand what the demand of the 

situation is and what should be done to get better results then we will be able to 

streamline our processes which in turn will lead to efficient operations.

 Effective Marketing – Market segmentation techniques have been implemented to 

target this important factor only in which we are supposed to find the marketing 

techniques which will help us increase our sales and leads to effective marketing 

strategies.

How Data Analytics Will Help a Business Grow:

1. Analysis of business value Chain:

There are companies that’ll help you in finding the insights of the value chains that are already

there in your organization and his is going to be done through data analytics.

2. Industry knowledge:

Industry knowledge is another thing that you’ll be able to comprehend once you get into data

analytics; it is going to show how you can go about your business in the near future and what is

that the economy already has its hands on. That’s how you are going to avail the benefit before

anyone else.

3. Seeing the opportunities:

As the economy keeps on changing and keeping pace with the dynamic trends is very

important but at the same time profit making is one thing that an organization would most of

the time aim for, Data Analytics gives us analyzed data that helps us in seeing opportunities

before the time that’s another way of unlocking more options.
BUSINESS ANALYTICS vs. DATA ANALYTICS
Business Analytics: Business analytics is a data-driven method used by organizations to gain
valuable insights into their business operations, improve decision-making processes, and
enhance overall performance. It involves the use of statistical analysis, predictive modeling,
data mining, and quantitative analysis to interpret data and make informed business decisions.
Importance of Business Analytics:
Informed Decision Making: Business analytics provides data-driven insights, enabling 
organizations to make informed decisions based on evidence rather than intuition.
Competitive Advantage: Analyzing market trends, customer behavior, and competitors’ 
strategies can help businesses gain a competitive edge by identifying opportunities and threats in 
the market.
Improved Efficiency: By analyzing operational data, organizations can identify inefficiencies 
and optimize processes, leading to cost savings and improved productivity.
Customer Insights: Business analytics helps in understanding customer preferences, behavior, 
and feedback, allowing businesses to tailor their products and services to meet customer needs 
effectively.
Risk Management: Analyzing historical and current data can help businesses identify potential 
risks and develop strategies to mitigate them, reducing the likelihood of losses.
Innovation: By analyzing data, businesses can identify patterns and trends that can lead to 
innovative product or service offerings, improving their position in the market.
Data Analytics:
Data analytics is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting complex 
datasets to extract valuable insights, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It involves 
various techniques from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to uncover patterns, 
trends, correlations, and other useful information within the data. The primary goal of data 
analytics is to gain a deeper understanding of data, solve problems, and aid in strategic decision-
making.
DATA ANALYTICS

Analytics is the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Especially, 

valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous 

application of statistics, computer programming, and operation research to qualify 

performance. Analytics often favors data visualization to communicate insight.

Firms may commonly apply analytics to business data, to describe, predict, and improve 

business performance. Especially, areas within include predictive analytics, enterprise decision 

management, etc. Since analytics can require extensive computation (because of big data), 

algorithms and software harness the most current methods in computer science.

Data Analytics aims to get actionable insights resulting in smarter decisions and better business 

outcomes.

It is critical to design and built a data warehouse or Business Intelligence (BI) architecture that 

provides a flexible, multi-faceted analytical ecosystem, optimized for efficient ingestion and 

analysis of large and diverse data sets.

What is Data Analytics?

In this new digital world, data is being generated in an enormous amount which opens new 

paradigm
  
use of this data to help us make data-driven decision making. The main benefits of data-driven 
decisions are that they are made up by observing past trends which have resulted in beneficial 
results.
In short, we can say that data analytics is the process of manipulating data to extract useful 
trends and hidden patterns which can help us derive valuable insights to make business 
predictions.
TYPES / CATEGORIES/ MODELS OF DATA ANALYTICS
There are four major types of data analytics:
1. Predictive (forecasting)
2. Descriptive (business intelligence and data mining)
3. Prescriptive (optimization and simulation)
4. Diagnostic analytics.

 Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics turn the data into valuable, actionable information. Predictive analytics 

uses data to determine the probable outcome of an event or a likelihood of a situation 

occurring. Predictive analytics holds a variety of statistical techniques from modeling, machine

learning, data mining, and game theory that analyze current and historical facts to make 

predictions about a future event. Techniques that are used for predictive analytics are:

 Linear Regression

 Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

 Data Mining

Basic Corner Stone’s of Predictive Analytics

 Predictive modeling

 Decision Analysis and optimization

 Transaction profiling

 Descriptive Analytics

Descriptive analytics looks at data and analyze past event for insight as to how to approach 

future events. It looks at past performance and understands the performance by mining 

historical data to understand the cause of success or failure in the past. Almost all management 

reporting such as sales, marketing, operations, and finance uses this type of analysis.

The descriptive model quantifies relationships in data in a way that is often used to classify 

customers or prospects into groups. Unlike a predictive model that focuses on predicting the 

behavior of a single customer, Descriptive analytics identifies many different relationships 

between customer and product.

Common examples of Descriptive analytics are company reports that provide historic

reviews like:

 Data Queries

 Reports

 Descriptive Statistics

 Data dashboard

 Prescriptive Analytics

Prescriptive Analytics automatically synthesize big data, mathematical science, business rule, 

and machine learning to make a prediction and then suggests a decision option to take 

advantage of the prediction.

Prescriptive analytics goes beyond predicting future outcomes by also suggesting action 

benefits from the predictions and showing the decision maker the implication of each decision 

option. Prescriptive Analytics not only anticipates what will happen and when to happen but 

also why it will happen. Further, Prescriptive Analytics can suggest decision options on how to 

take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk and illustrate the implication of 

each decision option.

For example, Prescriptive Analytics can benefit healthcare strategic planning by using 

analytics to leverage operational and usage data combined with data of external factors such as 

economic data, population demography, etc.

 Diagnostic Analytics

In this analysis, we generally use historical data over other data to answer any question or for 

the solution of any problem. We try to find any dependency and pattern in the historical data of 

the particular problem.

For example, companies go for this analysis because it gives a great insight into a problem, and 

they also keep detailed information about their disposal otherwise data collection may turn out 

individual for every problem and it will be very time-consuming. Common techniques used 

for Diagnostic Analytics are:

 Data discovery

 Data mining

 Correlations

TYPES OF DIGITAL DATA
 Unstructured Data: This is the data which does not conform to a data model or is not in a form 
which can be used easily by a computer program. About 80-90% data of an organizations is in 
this format; (e.g:memos, chat rooms, power point presentations, images, videos, letters, 
researchers, white papers, body of an email.etc.)
 Semi-Structured Data: This is the data which does not conform to a data model but has some 
structure. However it is not in a form which can be used easily by a computer program; for E.g.
Emails, XML, markup languages like html, EYX. 
 Structured Data: This is the data which is in an organized form (e.g: in rows and columns) and
can be easily used by a computer program. Relationships exist between entities of data, such as 
classes and their objects. Data stored in databases is an example of structured data.
DATA COLLECTION

Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in 

a systematic and organized manner. It is a fundamental step in the research process and is crucial 

for making informed decisions, conducting analyses, and drawing conclusions. Here are the key 

aspects of data collection:

1. Define the Objectives:

Clearly define the purpose of the data collection. What do you want to achieve? What questions 

are you trying to answer?

2. Choose Data Sources:

Determine the sources from which data will be collected. Sources can be primary (collected 

firsthand) or secondary (already existing data).

3. Select Data Collection Methods:
Surveys and Questionnaires: Structured sets of questions distributed to respondents.

Good data collection practices are essential for ensuring the reliability and validity of the 

collected information, which forms the basis for meaningful analysis and informed decision-

making.

DATA PREPROCESSING

Data preprocessing is an important step in the data mining process. It refers to the cleaning, 

transforming, and integrating of data in order to make it ready for analysis. The goal of data 

preprocessing is to improve the quality of the data and to make it more suitable for the specific 

data mining task.

 It is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable 

format.

Meaning:-Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis and machine learning process. 

It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format that can be effectively 

utilized for analysis or training machine learning models.
ELEMENTS:-
Data Quality:
Data quality measures how well a dataset meets criteria for accuracy, completeness, validity, 
consistency, uniqueness, timeliness, and fitness for purpose, and it is critical to all data 
governance initiatives within an organization.
Measures of Data Quality:
 Accuracy:
 Completeness
 Consistency
 Timeliness
 Believability
 Value added
 Interpretability
 Accessibility
Data Cleaning:
The data can have many irrelevant and missing parts. To handle this part, data cleaning is 
done. It involves handling of missing data, noisy data etc.
(a). Missing Data:
This situation arises when some data is missing in the data. It can be handled in various ways.
Some of them are:
1. Ignore the tuples:
This approach is suitable only when the dataset we have is quite large and multiple 
values are missing within a tuple.
 Fill the Missing values:
There are various ways to do this task. You can choose to fill the missing values manually, 
by attribute mean or the most probable value.
(b). Noisy Data:
Noisy data is a meaningless data that can’t be interpreted by machines.It can be generated 
due to faulty data collection, data entry errors etc. It can be handled in following ways :
1. Binning Method:
This method works on sorted data in order to smooth it. The whole data is divided into 
segments of equal size and then various methods are performed to complete the task. 
Each segmented is handled separately. One can replace all data in a segment by its mean 
or boundary values can be used to complete the task.
2. Regression:
Here data can be made smooth by fitting it to a regression function.The regression used 
may be linear (having one independent variable) or multiple (having multiple 
independent variables).
3. Clustering:

This approach groups the similar data in a cluster. The outliers may be undetected or it 

will fall outside the clusters.

Data Integration: This involves combining data from multiple sources to create a unified 

dataset. Data integration can be challenging as it requires handling data with different formats, 

structures, and semantics. Techniques such as record linkage and data fusion can be used for 

data integration.

Data Reduction:

Data reduction is a crucial step in the data mining process that involves reducing the size of the 

dataset while preserving the important information. This is done to improve the efficiency of 

data analysis and to avoid overfitting of the model. Some common steps involved in data 

reduction are:

Feature Selection: This involves selecting a subset of relevant features from the dataset. 

Feature selection is often performed to remove irrelevant or redundant features from the 

dataset. It can be done using various techniques such as correlation analysis, mutual 

information, and principal component analysis (PCA).

Feature Extraction: This involves transforming the data into a lower-dimensional space while 

preserving the important information. Feature extraction is often used when the original 

features are high-dimensional and complex. It can be done using techniques such as PCA, 

linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

Sampling: This involves selecting a subset of data points from the dataset. Sampling is often 

used to reduce the size of the dataset while preserving the important information. It can be 

done using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, and systematic sampling.

Clustering: This involves grouping similar data points together into clusters. Clustering is 

often used to reduce the size of the dataset by replacing similar data points with a 

representative centroid. It can be done using techniques such as k-means, hierarchical 

clustering, and density-based clustering.

Compression: This involves compressing the dataset while preserving the important 

information. Compression is often used to reduce the size of the dataset for storage and 

transmission purposes. It can be done using techniques such as wavelet compression, JPEG 

compression, and gzip compression.

Data Transformation:

This step is taken in order to transform the data in appropriate forms suitable for mining 

process. This involves following ways:

 Normalization:

It is done in order to scale the data values in a specified range (-1.0 to 1.0 or 0.0 to 1.0)

Attribute Selection:

In this strategy, new attributes are constructed from the given set of attributes to help 

the mining process.
 Discretization:

This is done to replace the raw values of numeric attribute by interval levels or 

conceptual levels.

 Concept Hierarchy Generation:

Here attributes are converted from lower level to higher level in hierarchy. For 

Example-The attribute “city” can be converted to “country”.

Data Discretization: This involves dividing continuous data into discrete categories or 

intervals. Discretization is often used in data mining and machine learning algorithms that 

require categorical data. Discretization can be achieved through techniques such as equal width 

binning, equal frequency binning, and clustering
Data Science Project Life Cycle

Earlier data used to be much less and generally accessible in a well-structured form, that we 

could save effortlessly and easily in Excel sheets, and with the help of Business Intelligence 

tools data can be processed efficiently. 

But Today we used to deals with large amounts of data like about 3.0 quintals bytes of records 

is producing on each and every day, which ultimately results in an explosion of records and 

data. According to recent researches, it is estimated that 1.9 MB of data and records are 

created in a second that too through a single individual.

So this is a very big challenge for any organization to deal with such a massive amount of data 

generating every second. For handling and evaluating this data we required some very 

powerful, complex algorithms and technologies and this is where Data science comes into the 

picture. 

The following are some primary motives for the use of Data science technology:

1. It helps to convert the big quantity of uncooked and unstructured records into 

significant insights.

2. It can assist in unique predictions such as a range of surveys, elections, etc.

3. It also helps in automating transportation such as growing a self-driving car; which 

can be the future of transportation.

4. Companies are shifting towards Data science and opting for this technology. 

Amazon, Netflix, etc, which cope with the big quantity of data, are the use of 

information science algorithms for higher consumer experience.

The data science project life cycle outlines the stages and steps involved in executing a data 

science project from conception to deployment. While the exact process can vary depending on 

the project and organization, the following is a common framework for the data science project 

life cycle:

The data science project life cycle is an iterative process, and it's important to maintain flexibility 
throughout each stage as new insights and challenges may arise. Collaboration, effective 
communication, and a focus on business objectives are key elements for success in data science 
projects.
Data Science Lifecycle revolves around the use of machine learning and different analytical 

strategies to produce insights and predictions from information in order to acquire a 

commercial enterprise objective. The complete method includes a number of steps like data 

cleaning, preparation, modelling, model evaluation, etc. It is a lengthy procedure and may 

additionally take quite a few months to complete. So, it is very essential to have a generic 

structure to observe for each and every hassle at hand. The globally mentioned structure in 

fixing any analytical problem is referred to as a Cross Industry Standard Process for Data 

Mining or CRISP-DM framework.

The lifecycle of Data Science
1. Business Understanding: The complete cycle revolves around the enterprise goal. 

What will you resolve if you do not longer have a specific problem? It is extraordinarily 

essential to apprehend the commercial enterprise goal sincerely due to the fact that will 

be your ultimate aim of the analysis. After desirable perception only we can set the 

precise aim of evaluation that is in sync with the enterprise objective. You need to 

understand if the customer desires to minimize savings loss, or if they prefer to predict 

the rate of a commodity, etc.

2. Data Understanding: After enterprise understanding, the subsequent step is data 

understanding. This includes a series of all the reachable data. Here you need to intently 

work with the commercial enterprise group as they are certainly conscious of what 

information is present, what facts should be used for this commercial enterprise 

problem, and different information. This step includes describing the data, their 

structure, their relevance, their records type. Explore the information using graphical 

plots. Basically, extracting any data that you can get about the information through 

simply exploring the data.

3. Preparation of Data: Next comes the data preparation stage. This consists of steps like 

choosing the applicable data, integrating the data by means of merging the data sets, 

cleaning it, treating the lacking values through either eliminating them or imputing 

them, treating inaccurate data through eliminating them, additionally test for outliers 

the use of box plots and cope with them. Constructing new data, derive new elements 

from present ones. Format the data into the preferred structure, eliminate undesirable 

columns and features. Data preparation is the most time-consuming but arguably the 

most essential step in the complete existence cycle. Your model will be as accurate as

your data.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: This step includes getting some concept about the answer 

and elements affecting it, earlier than constructing the real model. Distribution of data 

inside distinctive variables of a character is explored graphically the usage of bar-

graphs, Relations between distinct aspects are captured via graphical representations 

like scatter plots and warmth maps. Many data visualization strategies are considerably 

used to discover each and every characteristic individually and by means of combining 

them with different features.

5. Data Modelling: Data modelling is the coronary heart of data analysis. A model takes 

the organized data as input and gives the preferred output. This step consists of 

selecting the suitable kind of model, whether the problem is a classification problem, or 

a regression problem or a clustering problem. After deciding on the model family, 

amongst the number of algorithms amongst that family, we need to cautiously pick out 

the algorithms to put into effect and enforce them. We need to tune the hyper 

parameters of every model to obtain the preferred performance. We additionally need to 

make positive there is the right stability between overall performance and 

generalizability. We do no longer desire the model to study the data and operate poorly 

on new data.
6. Model Evaluation: Here the model is evaluated for checking if it is geared up to be 

deployed. The model is examined on an unseen data, evaluated on a cautiously thought 

out set of assessment metrics. We additionally need to make positive that the model 

conforms to reality. If we do not acquire a quality end result in the evaluation, we have 

to re-iterate the complete modelling procedure until the preferred stage of metrics is 

achieved. Any data science solution, a machine learning model, simply like a human, 

must evolve, must be capable to enhance itself with new data, adapt to a new evaluation 

metric. We can construct more than one model for a certain phenomenon; however, a 

lot of them may additionally be imperfect. The model assessment helps us select and 

construct an ideal model.

7. Model Deployment: The model after a rigorous assessment is at the end deployed in 

the preferred structure and channel. This is the last step in the data science life cycle. 

Each step in the data science life cycle defined above must be laboured upon carefully. 

If any step is performed improperly, and hence, have an effect on the subsequent step 

and the complete effort goes to waste. For example, if data is no longer accumulated 

properly, you’ll lose records and you will no longer be constructing an ideal model. If 

information is not cleaned properly, the model will no longer work. If the model is not 

evaluated properly, it will fail in the actual world. Right from Business perception to 

model deployment, every step has to be given appropriate attention, time, and effort.
Optimization in machine learning involves adjusting algorithms to better align with desired 

models. It's a great way to understand and optimize data. For example, your optimization 

algorithm can be trained to catch inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the system, removing the 

need for you to comb through data by hand.

Real-world Applications of Data Science

1.In Search Engines

The most useful application of Data Science is Search Engines. As we know when we want to

search for something on the internet, we mostly use Search engines like Google, Yahoo, Safari,

Firefox, etc. So Data Science is used to get Searches faster.

For Example, When we search for something suppose “Data Structure and algorithm courses”

then at that time on Internet Explorer we get the first link of GeeksforGeeks Courses. This

happens because the GeeksforGeeks website is visited most in order to get information

regarding Data Structure courses and Computer related subjects. So this analysis is done using

Data Science, and we get the topmost visited Web Links.

2. In Transport

Data Science is also entered in real-time such as the Transport field like Driverless Cars. With

the help of Driverless Cars, it is easy to reduce the number of Accidents.

For Example, In Driverless Cars the training data is fed into the algorithm and with the help

of Data Science techniques, the Data is analyzed like what![Caston project1_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2cf4043-e3b8-4f54-9de5-9f8b179156a8)
 as the speed limit in highways,

Busy Streets, Narrow Roads, etc. And how to handle different situations while driving etc.
